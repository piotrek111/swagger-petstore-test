# Swagger Petstore Technical Assignment
Job candidate: Piotr Szczepaniak

## General notes

1. I wrote the test ideas **_before_** any hands-on exercises with the API and as such they are based on my understanding of the documentation and other assumptions, mostly experience based.
2. Suggested functional test case are included in a separate file: [FUNCTIONAL TEST CASES.md](FUNCTIONAL%20TEST%20CASES.md)
3. I have also proposed some end-to-end test flows here: [END TO END TEST FLOWS.md](END%20TO%20END%20TEST%20FLOWS.md)
4. This README file will discuss technicalities behind my software solution for the test automation.
